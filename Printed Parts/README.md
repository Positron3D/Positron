# Positron v3.2 Printed Parts
Hello - all of these folders are what is required to build your Postiron.

In each folder, you will find a readme, this will act as a general Key for the naming of the files, as well as a spot where we've added advisories for some parts. This is as simple as informing you if a part will not be seen from the exterior, if a part will be closely intact with a high temperature item such as a motor, or if a part is reccomended to be non-conductive for electrical isolation.

Please note that the folders here are grouped by assembly, and not by reccomended order of assembly. Please be sure to follow the guides provided on our wiki.

# Recommended Print Settings

 - We reccomend printing all parts in ABS or ASA, but yuo can print some parts in other colors.
